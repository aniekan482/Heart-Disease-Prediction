# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various machine learning models. The dataset used contains various patient attributes, and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alexsingth/heart-disease-dataset) from Kaggle.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git](https://github.com/aniekan482/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/Data/heart.csv)
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
3. Install the required dependencies:    
     ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage  
1. Data Preprocessing:
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess.py

2. Model Training:
Train the models using the training script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
3. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models using the evaluation script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate.py

## Results
The best-performing model was the Random Forest classifier with an accuracy of 88%. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
